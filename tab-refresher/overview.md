# Tab Refresher Overview

This is an extension that is currently working in the Chrome browser on Mick's computer. Also, it should be able to work in other browsers like Edge if necessary.

## How Does It Work

This extension automatically runs in the background over and over to refresh the Ebay and Amazon order pages. Currently, it does this every 15 minutes. This causes the "Download Orders" extension to trigger and download and new orders it finds.

## Set Up

To load this extension go to extensions in the Chrome browser and click load unpacked. Then select the folder to upload. (Be sure that Developer Mode is turned on.)

Once loaded, it will continue to run until turned off in extensions.
