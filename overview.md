# Main Overview

Here is a high level overview of what the program does.

The "Chrome-Download Files" component runs in the Chrome browser to download the orders from Ebay or Amazon that need to be shipped. The "Excel to Json" component then converts the .csv file or .txt file into JSON and sends it to a master JSON file. Next the "Amazon Order Input Program" or "Ebay Order Input Program" uses this data to display the information and enables the copy and paste feature on the "Order Entry" page in P21.
